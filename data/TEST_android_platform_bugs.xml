<description>Prior to Android 2.2 developers of soft keyboards could detect that the
user was typing in a web form by looking for the
InputType.TYPE_TEXT_VARIATION_WEB_EDIT_TEXT flag. On Android 2.2 this is
not possible since the Browser/WebView simply specifies
InputType.TYPE_TEXT_VARIATION_NORMAL instead. This change is not neither
documented or needed. It occurred between 2.1 and 2.2 build FRF50 on
Nexus One.</description>

<what>Bummer. Thanks for the quick confirmation anyway. Please consider removing the flag
IME_FLAG_NO_EXTRACT_UI that was added in the web forms in 2.2 as well.</what>

<description>There are current enhancement requests for more granular control of the
display timeout/display locking functions. However, I do not see one
that raises the issue of docking stations. I, too, would like to have
separate display and lock timers so that my screen will go dark after a
specified amount of time to save battery, but Q&quot;EwakingQ&quot;E it is as simply
as taking any user action. I would prefer to choose to lock the screen
manually only when IQ&apos;Em putting the phone away/in a pocket/etc. That
said, I would like to either have the display never sleep/never lock, or
have a separate timeout parameter for when the phone is Q&quot;EdockedQ&quot;E such as
when itQ&apos;Es placed into a charging cradle like that for the new Moto
Droid. The device already exhibits different behavior once docked
(screen options, orientation, etc.). One of the features is acting like
an alarm clock. If the display timesout after a few minutes according to
the single timout setting, then itQ&apos;Es not very useful as an alarm clock.
Please add this to the development plan when screen timeout is to be
addressed. Thanks.</description>

<what>As an update, at least on a Motorola Droid, when in a Q&quot;Edocking stationQ&quot;E the screen 
backlight seems to obey the single timeout setting, however the display does not 
lock. So it seems that there is alread an exception in code that prevents the lock 
from taking effect when docked - in fact I cannot seem to force the device to lock 
at all (which I would consider a bug, not a feature), but the timeout is respected 
(which I donQ&apos;Et want).</what>

<what>I agree.  Have Moto Droid on docking station and screen times out anyway.  WhatQ&apos;Es 
the point of offering a docking station with a handy dandy clock/weather 
display/etc. if itQ&apos;Es just going to go to sleep anyway?

It does this whether I have Slacker Radio playing or just have it sitting there 
in Q&quot;Eclock mode.Q&quot;E</what>

<what>The screen stays on while docked, but if you want to turn it off, go to 
Settings/Applications/Development and check off the Q&apos;Enever sleep while chargingQ&apos;E.

<description>Every few days I get a Notification that reads: Message not downloaded
Select to review the message and try..(7:10am) I think these come from
email to SMS gateways that are sending me messages that are too long.
Selecting that notification leads me to a confusing place... the
Q&quot;EComposeQ&quot;E SMS screen, with Q&quot;E(!) Undelivered message/Unable to send this
messageQ&quot;E showing for a few seconds, before reverting to the normal
compose screen. If I cancel out of that, I sometimes can get an offer to
Download the message, which never works.

<description>I have a Samsung Nexus S running Android 2.3.4. IQ&apos;Em not sure what
prompted this problem, but starting yesterday, when I was in picture
(not video) mode in the Camera app, the preview window would turn black
and restart every two seconds or so, making it almost impossible to take
a picture. Restarting the phone would not help. IQ&apos;Eve captured the log
during two or three restart cycles and attached it to this bug report. I
was able to fix the problem by clearing all data from the Camera app, in
app management. So even if this bug is not fixed (since I donQ&apos;Et even
know how to reproduce it), this bug report may at least help other users
with the same problem.</description>

<description>Phone: Nexus One Version: 2.1-update1 I have 2 separate users both with
the same First and Last name. They both have different middle names. I
setup their names as they appear on Facebook in Google contacts. Contact
1: One Three Contact 2: One Two Three On my phone contacts it merges
both these accounts. This is really irritating. The actual behavior
should show both the contacts separately since they do not have any
information that overlaps (except for the first and last name).</description>

<description>Nexus One, Android 2.2.2, FRG83G I received the 2.2.2 OTA update
yesterday. After installing, my camera app will not work properly. It
was working without issue before the update. When you open camera it
pops up like normal at first, But then starts flashing the screen on and
off. The Q&quot;EviewfinderQ&quot;E (display) will flash off for a second and then
back on. The menu with flash settings, timer, etc. goes with it as well.
And if it stays open, it will just do that forever, flash on and off.
The camera will take photos if I can time it to catch it when the
viewfinder is on, but that is difficult. I can slide from still camera
to video, the video will record and work. No flashing screen. But if I
slide it back to still picture, it will start the flashing on and off
all over again. Video included of me starting the camera app, showing
what happens.</description>

I finally tried a factory reset.  All data was erased and system is back to default settings and that seems to have fixed the camera issue.</what>

Please do so under the appropriate section of the Google Mobile Help Forum so the right people can take a look at it.

Out of curiousity, why has this been declined, as this does appear to be an issue with the Android update? Is it due to this being an OTA update for Nexus One specifically?</what>

<what>Update: after toggling both of the location settings in the main Q&apos;Elocation privacyQ&apos;E section and clearing the Camera applicationQ&apos;Es data, the issue seems to be resolved for now. It seems while this problem existed Google Maps could not correctly access the GPS/location information either.

Hope this helps people discovering this thread. :)</what>

<description>My phone itQ&apos;Es a Samsung Nexus S (i9023), Android version itQ&apos;Es
Gingerbread 2.3.4, base band version I9023XD, kernel version
2.6.35.7-ge282d80 android-build@apa28 #1, IMEI: 355921041216712 ItQ&apos;Es
been happening since I got this phone in Spain. But I live in Argentina,
IQ&apos;Em using Movistar (Telef?nica) as a cell provider, and I notice most of
my sms doesnQ&apos;Et arrive ok to the recipients... I`m not talking about MMS,
just plain and simple SMS. When this fail happens the sms show a big
black bar over the words of the message, instead of text, letters, etc
you see just a black bar... IQ&apos;Em attaching you a photo of a Motorola V3i
that I owe, itQ&apos;Es not just this phone, itQ&apos;Es happens in a great number of
my friendQ&apos;Es phones too, differents brands, models and technologies.
Testing and investigating a little bit I found that this happens mostly
when I use the accentuation letters of the spanish language (my
language), meaning the letters: Q&quot;E?Q&quot;E, Q&quot;E?Q&quot;E, Q&quot;E?Q&quot;E, Q&quot;E?Q&quot;E, Q&quot;E?Q&quot;E or the Q&quot;EspecialQ&quot;E
letters Q&quot;E?Q&quot;E Q&quot;E?Q&quot;E and de Q&quot;E?Q&quot;E o r Q&quot;E?Q&quot;E. IQ&apos;Eve look around in forums and some
people have the same fails. Some says itQ&apos;Es an accentuation issue some
others said itQ&apos;Es a problem of Q&quot;ElenghQ&quot;E o the sms, that when your sms
passes the 160 character limit Android fails in Q&quot;EchoppingQ&quot;E the sms in
two or more messages. I donQ&apos;Et know, for me itQ&apos;Es the accentuation issue.
I hope you guys can check it out because itQ&apos;Es a really frustranting when
people show you in their phoners that your message it?s unintelligible,
itQ&apos;Es just big black bar instead of text... Thank you very much, please
if you read this or find a solution please sent a email to

Same problem with Portuguese characters :(
I am using HTC Legend.
Comment 2 by Filipe...@gmail.com, May 12, 2010
Happens here too.
My Q&quot;EoldQ&quot;E windows mobile had an option to disable Unicode character.

HTC Desire
Comment 3 by os2an...@gmail.com, May 13, 2010
Same with HTC Hero :(
I only noticed this lately. IQ&apos;Eve been wasting a lot o money in SMSs without knowing.
Perhaps we should consider suing Google/Android because they do not warn about this
problem!
My Windows Smartphone also has an option to disable Unicode.
Shame on Android :(
Comment 4 by stuar...@gmail.com, May 13, 2010
I had an option on my Samsung Omnia too to disable Unicode...

We have to tweet as much as we can about this thread to make come more people...

BTW, IQ&apos;Em using HTC Magic...
Comment 5 by vaclav.l...@gmail.com, May 14, 2010
There is a big need for this simple feature! Every damned nokia can do that and 
unfortunately I could not find any stock app (not even paid) that could do this. Has 
somebody already found (any) solution?
Comment 6 by pierre.burel, Jun 11, 2010
ItQ&apos;Es a shame this issue isnQ&apos;Et fixed yet.
IQ&apos;Eve read that third-party messaging applications (chompSMS or Handcent SMS) donQ&apos;Et have this problem.
Please Google, there are other languages than english !

IQ&apos;Em using a HTC Desire running stock Android 2.1 with Sense (btw, maybe this is fixed in Froyo ?)
Comment 7 by nando...@gmail.com, Jul 25, 2010
Same problem, Desire and 2.1 u1 here.
Comment 8 by fabio.fr...@gmail.com, Aug 11, 2010
Sama issue, HTC Magic w/Android 1.6.. Money wasted on unreadable messages as I write in Italian and Spanish.. 
Comment 9 by nando...@gmail.com, Aug 11, 2010
Its a shame Android got this problem, I find its a major bug, and if its not a bug its not a correct solution. First phone with this problem, even 10 years ago ones worked perfectly.
Comment 10 by powe...@gmail.com, Aug 22, 2010
ItQ&apos;Es amazing but, it looks like that, even froyo still does not fix this issue.
For android developers, it looks like that English is the only language in the world.
Going back to a windows mobile device, where there is no such problem.
At least, Microsoft acknowledges that there are more languages around.
Have fun ;)
Comment 11 by barb...@gmail.com, Oct 6, 2010
Same problem with Portuguese, no resolution yet.

Comment 12 by eduardov...@gmail.com, Oct 8, 2010
Same issue in HTC Desire 2.2.

I also tried other apps (Handcent SMS, ChompSMS), but the problem persists.
Comment 13 by antoniod...@gmail.com, Dec 2, 2010
Interestingly, Samsung Galaxy does not have that issue.
I sent my HTC legend for repairing, but it came back the same.
They say that I should wait for an update that MAYBE will solve the problem.
LOL

I am returning the phone to the seller to get refunded.

New versions of handcent already solve the problem. CanQ&apos;Et tell how many languages it solves the issues right now, but iQ&apos;Em from Portugal and it does and more 6 or 7.

Amazing how the guys from Handcent create a free app to solve this and a few more messaging issues and Google itself doesnQ&apos;Et give a f...! I understand that a few united states operators have the issue solved on 2.2 but thatQ&apos;Es it. Just them and not all of them. Google should solve the issue on the basic level and make it work all around, without workarounds from other people.

Bottomline -Q&gt;E Use Handcent, they did it!

I confirm the issue in French on my Desire Z. Took me several days to understand why I sent 5 messages with only 200 or 300 characters.
Definitely needs a fix.

Hello all.

Have any of you had the chance to test on Gingerbread? I just tested on my Nexus One with stock 2.3.3 (Gingerbread). It does appear to work with a short message sent from and to the same device. At least I am not getting a garbled message.

Comment 30 by zip...@gmail.com, Mar 29, 2011
Issue present on my LG Optimus S running stock 2.2.

First part of the problem is when I receive a message from a non android phone (like a W7 or IOS phone) that is using accentuations (?) the phone cant understand the font or character set and the message comes out like this:

H o l a. M i  c e l u l a r  e s t ?  d a ? a d o.

With spaces after every letter and the ? character replacing any latin specific characters.

Second part of the problem is when I send a message to a non Android phone. The messages come out differently garbled and with @ characters all over the place. This only happens if I use a latin specific character.

Im surprised Google hasnt done anything about this yet as it would affect all phones sold outside of the US.


Comment 31 by thiago...@gmail.com, May 19, 2011
I have the same problem
IQ&apos;Em using a Samsung Nexus S, Android 2.3.4.
Every time a try to send a sms with some special characters, like: ?, ?, ?... everything gets messed up. The receiver just receives squares.
However, with some carriers here in Brazil, the issue does not occur. But 99% of the times I can reproduce it.
Comment 32 by carole.w...@gmail.com, May 21, 2011
I have the same problem, since I send text messages in several languages. However, for now, I get around by spelling words in a phonetic way. If I want to write Q&quot;Ea?oQ&quot;E I write Q&quot;EanioQ&quot;E, because I donQ&apos;Et want people to think IQ&apos;Em writing a dirty word :-) I use a Samsung Galaxy S GT10000 and I find it ridiculous indeed that even after more than a year of commenting on this subject (the oldest post is dated Feb 7, 2010) nothing has been changed!!!!!!!!
Comment 33 by edp...@gmail.com, May 21, 2011
It seems you all did not know about this bug when you bought the phone.
Will you buy it again now that you know about this and other bugs?
Or will you buy a non Android phone?
How did you get informed about the operating system of the phone to buy?
Did you know about this issue tracker?
Did you know about a comparison of Mobile Operating Systems like:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_operating_system#Smartphone_OS_comparison
?
How would you like being informed about these issues when you bought the phone?

Comment 34 by zip...@gmail.com, May 21, 2011
This bug is preventing me from communicating properly wirh my friends. I canQ&apos;Et believe this has not been fixed. I will look at how google, manufacturers, and providers  update android phones in the future. If they keep ignoring these types of bugs and not update phones, then I will look into a OS provider that will. 
Comment 35 by krak...@gmail.com, May 22, 2011
@Comment 33 by edp..@gmail.com: what, are you working for some company and running surveys?
Comment 36 by edp...@gmail.com, May 23, 2011
I just want to let people know that Android has many bugs, like this, that Google is not willing to fix, and that other OSs do not have these bugs.
So, I want to know how did you get informed when you bought the phone so we can provide this info and not let people make such bad decisions.
Comment 37 by zip...@gmail.com, May 23, 2011

All OSes have bugs, of course, iOS has them, Windows Mobile has them (and, in this case, it has the exact same bug), itQ&apos;Es way too stupid to say that they donQ&apos;Et. The answers to the questions youQ&apos;Ere making are NONE of your business.
Comment 39 by edp...@gmail.com, May 29, 2011
I am not in a crusade against Android. I would really like Android to be the best OS, but currently it is not. I know all OSes have bugs. I just want people to get the best information in order to choose a phone. Of course you should not answer any question, if you are not willing to collaborate. These questions are only intended for people that want the best OS for their phone.

<description>This includes the programmatic system wide brightness setting. And yes,
system wide setting can be changed. This would be a horrible thing to
see exploited. If exploited, this could force users to reload their
phone. I have dimmed display on hardware running 1.5 with the 1.5 SDK.

<description>It is not possible to uninstall an application from the market panel if,
since installation, a newer version has been released. To reproduce:
install an app, in the market applet the buttons at the bottom say
[Open] and [Uninstall]. Wait until a newer version of the app is
available. Then in the market it says [Install] with no way to uninstall
the older version without first installing the new version, and then
uninstalling the new one, a waste of time and bandwidth It would be
better to have the options [Open], [Uninstall], [Upgrade] or something
similar</description>

shows that they are zero-sized and no picture content was saved. I have

<description>I recently experienced an issue with a 3rd party launcher app. This
launcher was set as my default home app. After a reboot, when I unlocked
the device the 3rd party app got an error and gave me the force close
prompt. But because there had not been any other apps recently run, the
home screen app was then relaunched by default, which gave me another
force close prompt. This loop continued until I had to uninstall the app
with ADB. The enhancement IQ&apos;Em suggesting is to clear the default
launcher if it is set to a 3rd party launcher, and that launcher has
gone into a FC loop (or itQ&apos;Es had to be force closed 3 times in 5
minutes, for example). This would cause the prompt to come up that would
allow the user to switch home apps to fix the problem and use their
phone. When this happened to me, I was lucky and was home with a
computer with the SDK installed. Had that not been the case, my phone
would have been practically useless until I could get to a computer and
use ADB. For less tech savvy folks, this could cause them to have to
take their phone into a store to be reset. Pretty big problem with a
reasonably simple solution. Android version: 2.3.3</description>

<description>Android 2.2.1 (kernel version 2.6.32.21-g6e170e7) on HTC Desire Z
(reproducible in the emulator as well). Create empty application and use
the attached file as main activityQ&apos;Es XML code. Leave the .java file
unchanged. Build and export application as .apk file, then run either on
emulator or on real device. Real device behavior: screen orientation
change while application is running does nothing more than expected.
However, if one exit application by pressing Q&quot;EbackQ&quot;E key, then change
orientation and then run it again, it crashes. Emulator behavior: screen
orientation change while application is running crashes it after a few
attempts. Call stack follows: Thread [Q&lt;E1Q&gt;E main] (Suspended (exception

<description>I have an HTC Desire purchased in Beijing in December 2010. This
afternoon I ran my phone battery down to dead. When I turned it back on
the phone was in Chinese instead of English and about half of my
applications (including Android Marketplace) were missing from the home
screens AND the selection of all my apps. If I go to settings -Q&gt;E
applications -Q&gt;E manage apps I can see the names of the apps but the
icons are missing. I cannot clear data on any of the apps nor can I move
to/from the sdcard. I was able to uninstall one of the less important
apps. Another app that I tried to uninstall would not uninstall. -M</description>

<description>IQ&apos;Em working on an app that maintains an ongoing notification that
updates regularly (every 5 or 10 minutes). I do NOT want to alert the
user every time this update occurs but I donQ&apos;Et see any way of disabling
the icon/text notification when I perform an update. Adding a flag to
NOT show the icon/text in the top area would be great!</description>

<what>Please make the notification icon optional. 

Many people have requested this feature (option) in my app Q&quot;EStatusNotesQ&quot;E (com.ipaulpro.statusnotes). This would 
allow notifications to be created that do not take up valuable status bar space.

Currently, a notification requires an icon. My current work-around is a transparent .png spacer, that gives the 
illusion of a hidden icon. However, this often creates an undesirable space between icons in the status bar.

There is no flag necessary, simply make the icon parameter of the Notification object optional. If nothing else, this 
should really be possible for Ongoing Notifications (FLAG_ONGOING_EVENT).

Star this issue if you want Android notifications without icons!</what>

<description>Android Browser fails in HTTP basic authentication under some
conditions. - Steps to reproduce the problem (1)access to a page which
requires HTTP basic authentication (2)browser shows dialog for username
and password (3)enter wrong user name and password (ex) aaa / pass
(4)browser fails in authentication, and shows dialog again (5)enter
correct user name and password (ex) usr01 / pass (6)browser succeeds in
authentication for only the page (7)for subsequent pages, browser fails
in authentication - Cause of this problem In the Android Framework
(WebKit), WebViewDatabase has a database for basic authentication, its
table name is Q&quot;EhttpauthQ&quot;E. The table is defined as bellow create table
httpauth ( id ...., host ...., realm ...., username ...., password ...,
unique(host,realm,username) on conflict replace ); after procedure
described above, table Q&quot;EhttpauthQ&quot;E has two records. 1,
www.somecompany.com, somerealm, aaa, pass 2, www.somecompany.com,
somerealm, usr01, pass and then, if the browser needs to get username
and password, it selects record from Q&quot;EhttpauthQ&quot;E and always uses the
first record. (source code: WebViewDatabase.java method:
getHttpAuthUsernamePassword) I think the table definition should be
corrected as bellow. create table httpauth ( id ...., host ...., realm
...., username ...., password ..., unique(host,realm) on conflict
replace ); * (host,realm) should be a unique key -------- *affected

<what>This specific fix was made in Sept 2009 and was probably related to the way we cache the authentication results, but should not have affected the authentication headers. There have been a lot of changes between Eclair and Froyo, including an updated webkit and updated networking. I did not find a change specific to basic authentication or ajax requests in our internal bug database.</what>

<description>Hi , I bought Sony Ericsson Xperia erc and it was with android version
3.2, however after upgrading to android 3.3 media files such as pictures
I take they disappear after taking them in in 24 hours upto 2 days, if I
connect the mobile to the pc they still exists in the memory but they
dont appear on the media bar in the mobile. Ideally such photos and
songs I download should be available from the mobile not only when I
connect the mobile to the pc. Please contact me as I want to solve this
issue.</description>

<description>Have an HTC Magic+, Android 2.1 (Rogers). Previously had voice dialling
that was activated by pressing main button on BT headset (Rogers Android
1.5 , pre-911 bug fix). When we were promised 2.1, we were also told
that voice dialling activated via BT would be restored with that update.
This still does not seem to function. There is voice-activated dialling,
but you have to launch the app by pressing a button on the phone
(long-press call button) and then press a screen button to confirm the
app got the right number/function. Either one of these actions alone is
illegal if using the phone while driving where I live (Ontario, Canada).
Major safety and legal issues here. DonQ&apos;Et understand why this
functionality disappeared with the 911 update, donQ&apos;Et understand why an
advacned smartphone canQ&apos;Et use BT properly, when my old dumb phones used
it years ago.</description>

<what>Agree, this is still an issue with v2.2 from what I can make out. I have a HTC DesireHD.
In order to get around the 1st problem of actually initiating the call via the BT headset I use BowTie. This seems to work, but does not actually call the number, just brings up on the screen and you need to press to dial. Close but no cigar</what>

tvbuf.setAutoLinkMask(Linkify.WEB_URLS); tvbuf.setText(text + Q&quot;E\nQ&quot;E);
tv.append(tvbuf.getText());</description>

<when>Wed, 19 Nov 2008 14:24:44 +0000</when>
<what>I also having this problem and the workaround above does not work for me. The code I
am using is below:

EditText et = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.et);
TextView tv = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.tv);

et.setOnKeyListener(new OnKeyListener() {
      	@Override
   		public boolean onKey(View v, int i, KeyEvent e) {
			if (i == 66) { //Enter key
	    				
  				String s = et.getText().toString();
	    				
   				if (s.equals(Q&quot;EQ&quot;E) || s.equals(Q&quot;E\nQ&quot;E)) {
	    					
   					return true;
   				}	
	    				
	    					
   				tv.append(s + Q&quot;E\nQ&quot;E);
	    					
   				et.setText(null);
	    					
   				return true;
	    				
   			}
	    			
  			return false;
   		}

});

In my XML file, the code for the Textview is:

Q&lt;ETextView
	android:id=Q&quot;E@+id/tvQ&quot;E
	android:layout_width=Q&quot;Ewrap_contentQ&quot;E
	android:layout_height=Q&quot;Ewrap_contentQ&quot;E
	android:textSize=Q&quot;E12pxQ&quot;E
	android:autoLink=Q&quot;Eweb|emailQ&quot;EQ&gt;E
	
This is wrapped inside a ScrollView. The root element of the XML file is a
RelativeLayout.

Strangely enough, once I change orientation and then back to the original, the text
is linkified.

Software:
Eclipse 3.4.0
android-sdk-windows-1.0_r1	
Windows XP SP3

<what>Perhaps someone is interested in: As notnyt wrote, simply use a buffer (StringBuilder, 
StringBuffer or just a String, if you like) for the text.
Use setAutoLinkMask() and write the String to the TextView by calling setText() at 
once. That should do the trick.

<description>An attempt to get all available configurations in EGL will fail with a
NullPointerException. Code to reproduce: ================== EGL10 mEgl =
(EGL10) EGLContext.getEGL(); EGLDisplay mEglDisplay =
mEgl.eglGetDisplay(EGL10.EGL_DEFAULT_DISPLAY); int[] version = new
int[2]; mEgl.eglInitialize(mEglDisplay, version); EGLConfig[] configs =
new EGLConfig[100]; int[] num_config = new int[100];
mEgl.eglGetConfigs(mEglDisplay, configs, 1, num_config); Reason: =======
In the JNI implementation of the method: jboolean
jni_eglGetConfigs(JNIEnv *_env, jobject _this, jobject display,
jobjectArray configs, jint config_size, jintArray num_config) The
following lines are problematic: -------------------------- jobject obj
= _env-Q&gt;EGetObjectArrayElement(configs, i); if (obj == NULL) {
doThrow(_env, Q&quot;Ejava/lang/NullPointerExceptionQ&quot;E); break; }
_env-Q&gt;ESetIntField(obj, gConfig_EGLConfigFieldID,
(jint)nativeConfigs[i]); -------------------------- Since, the Q&apos;EconfigsQ&apos;E
array will always have NULL elements, the exception will ALWAYS be
thrown. User cannot manually construct an array of EGLConfigs, and
therefor cannot use this function at all.</description>

<what>Hi, was this defect fixed in CupCake or Donut?
We still observe the same issue.
If we change device orientation several times (more then 20) and do not wait screen 
repaint on each rotation we get an OutOfMemoryError. On each rotation the 
getInstanceCount() is increased. If we change device orientation when screen have been 
repainted - all is fine. We have double checked that we do not save any context 
instances or so on. </what>

<what>IQ&apos;Em adding this comment without having first searched through other issues so it may
be redundant, and I may redundantly comment on other reports as I continue... jbgQ&apos;Es
description is just one of the symptoms that seem to accompany a reproduceable
problem, i say reproduceable, because the reports of this problem on the net seem to
be similar enough and frequent enough to conclude they are describing the same thing.
 My Touch3G developed the set of symptoms this afternoon, IQ&apos;Em racking my brain trying
to think if i did anything different and/or when precisely the issue arose. At this
point I can consistantly play with ALL security settings (exhaustively tried each
possible combinations of settings (use screen lock, give tactile feedback, reset
pattern,....) and no change in the behavior occurs. Power-down-up: no change.   Pull
battery: no change. A fairly comprehensive descriptions of the issues are found in:

http://androidforums.com/t-mobile-mytouch-3g/12021-home-search-buttons-not-working-not-sleeping-locking-properly.html

My phone shows all the symptoms described:

*The Home button no longer brings me to the home screen, in fact it does nothing
*The phone no longer uses my pattern to unlock, though it is still enabled in the
settings. I can press any key (including end) when the screen turns off and it just
brings the screen right back up (whichever screen/application I was on last). This is
the same whether it times out or I hit End.
*The Search button is equally as ineffective as the Home button, only functioning to
turn the screen back on.
*Holding down the End button no longer gives me the options of Silent/Sleep/Power.
Only Power is available.

I hadnQ&apos;Et installed any applications recently enough for them to be logical triggers.


Another thread describing what is probably the same thing:

http://forums.t-mobile.com/t5/General-Help/Screen-will-not-lock/m-p/289265;jsessionid=709C024D73DD76315B4D3A7B144D2797

<what>1. in comment 2 substitute Q&quot;Ealena.nskQ&quot;E for Q&quot;EjbgQ&quot;E (My apologies to the reviewer).

2. This may be totally unrelated, but I did have my first low-power warning about 24
hours ago. The low power warning surprised me as I hadnQ&apos;Et used the phone enough since
last charge to expect to see such a condition. However the phone had been sitting in
a back-pack with the facebook app trying to upload a pict (personally, from the delay
i suspect the facebook app or the server it was talking to was stuck in deadlock or
infinite loop). When the warning occurred and to get facebook out of the task stack
(no way to kill it), i immeadiately powered down the phone an powered it up --  the
low-battery condition was cleared.

3. firmware: 1.6
build: drc92

4. I am more than willing to help explore this issue if it lands on an engineerQ&apos;Es
desk soon, but this is my primary phone so a factory reset is going to occur if it
isnQ&apos;Et going to get immediate attention.  I have the SDK installed and functional on
an Ubuntu box in eclipse.  I have no problem if somebody wants ssh access (they can
tunnel X); and, if really necessary, I can munge my firewall and enable VNC.

     * if keyguard screen is showing or in restricted key input mode (i.e. in
     * keyguard password emergency screen). When in such mode, certain keys,
     * such as the Home key and the right soft keys, donQ&apos;Et work.
     *
     * @return true if in keyguard restricted input mode.

<what>also of questionable value another clue: the ringtone for notifications changed. IQ&apos;Em
hoping nothing corrupted a persistent sql table?  

That aside, I will attempt to learn how to use adb log monitoring to trace the flow in: 

http://android.git.kernel.org/?p=platform/frameworks/policies/base.git;a=blob_plain;f=phone/com/android/internal/policy/impl/KeyguardViewMediator.java
 

as it appears to contain all the logic regards the state of locking.

Unfortunately, iQ&apos;Em way to java/android ignorant to do much more.</what>

<what>
In a system dump, I think I found the problem:

02-03 10:05:55.222 I/CallNotifier(  121): CallNotifier: rejecting incoming call:
device isnQ&apos;Et provisioned

which means somehow (????) the key Q&quot;Edevice_provisionedQ&quot;E in 

/data/data/com.android.providers.settings/databases/settings.db 

has been changed to zero.

My phone is not rooted; so I donQ&apos;Et (yet) have a way of resetting this flag.  

QUESTION ONE: is there a permission flag in manifest file that would allow me to
write a small activity to reset this flag?  

QUESTION TWO: in the interests of the user base, I would still like to find out how Q&amp;E
why this occurred on my phone. One of two things occurred: (1) an application with
the manifest flag (assuming it exists?? -- i.e. my QUESTION ONE) changed the value,
or (2) a bug exists somewhere such that the database file was corrupted. I find this
unlikely as file corruption usually is way more drastic than one or two changed
settings!!! (Remember from my other comment that a ringtone was also changed !! --
same database file).

Please note, my issue arose on a stock release of Touch 3G. It is not, never has
been, rooted/jail-broken. It is what the 100 of thousands of other T-mobile end-users
have. To tell them they need to factory-reset their phone (my current option), to
reset this flag is not a a very user/customer friendly solution. Some piece of
software on the phone screwed up the flag!!!  The customer base needs a
utility/patch/update to set it. Several internet sites recommend some method of
re-running set-up via another piece of software, but that solution is still to arcane
for the average customer.</what>

<what>IQ&apos;Eve encountered this twice since my original flurry of comments. IQ&apos;Em now suspecting
that it occurs while my phone is tethered with adb and IQ&apos;Em in a traditional
development cycle (compile, install, run, fix-bug, compile, install, run). I know
this is totally vague (useless) for reproducing/tracking down. But until I figure it
out, IQ&apos;Em using (probably inappropriate or bad etiquette?) this issue as a place to
keep notes. My phone is not rooted and I donQ&apos;Et have the necessary signature files to
do system/hardware stuff, so nothing in my code should be able to touch the
settings/files that change.</what>

<description>Instead of just having Q&quot;Ecall this numberQ&quot;E as an option, maybe add Q&quot;Ecall
this number until I get through.Q&quot;E I donQ&apos;Et know, though-- this might
result in folks Q&quot;Ecalling a number until they get throughQ&quot;E, and waiting
so long that they put the phone down Q&amp;E walk away, leaving the person
they called and finally got through to wondering why their phone rang
with no one on the other end? But assuming *most* people wouldnQ&apos;Et be
that irresponsible, *maybe* itQ&apos;Es a good idea. Maybe make it optional and
default to Q&apos;Enot available as a calling optionQ&apos;E, as IQ&apos;Ed guess most folks
donQ&apos;Et browse through their settings. Maybe itQ&apos;Es *only* an option on a
missed call in the call log due to a busy signal. And maybe once you
connect, itQ&apos;Es removed as an option from everything in the call log for
this number. This paragraph is so that folks donQ&apos;Et overuse (and maybe
abuse) the Q&quot;Ecall until connectedQ&quot;E feature until they at least try ONCE,
and get a busy signal. After they try regular dial at least once, and
itQ&apos;Es busy, if they then visit that entry in the call log, Q&quot;Ecall until
not busyQ&quot;E has appeared. Just a thought.</description>

<what>Well, to my thinking, yes Q&amp;E no.  With email-- IF this contact has email, does your grandma?-- you are pretty sure only that theyQ&apos;Ell see the message someday.  That works for anything thatQ&apos;Es not time sensitive.  But that doesnQ&apos;Et work when they REALLY donQ&apos;Et get to email very often-- remember, much of the world doesnQ&apos;Et get email on their cell phones-- and you really do need to deliver this message soon.  To me, the difference is Q&quot;EHey, I can check my email any olQ&apos;E time, so why nowQ&quot;E vs. Q&quot;EOoh, hey, the phone is ringing right now.Q&quot;E  I mean, even if an answering machine picks up, I highly suspect that gets checked more often than email in MOST cases.  Just food for the conversation-- thoughts?  I know this may turn into a somewhat controversial feature request, thatQ&apos;Es why it should be talked out well.  But hey, open-source technology is changing the landscape of many models weQ&apos;Eve held for years, why not change the way the phone game is played?</what>

When it rings, dismiss the alarm. * Then, you can very briefly see the
contents of the screen and interact with the phone as if it were
unlocked. - What you think the correct behaviour should be. * If the
phone is locked, you should not be able to see the contents of the

<description>I use HTC Sync to sync with outlook. I have all day events (by default
have no reminder) and some events that have no reminder set. Despite
this, the reminder noise will play when the event starts (midnight for
all day). I have tried setting setting the Alerts Q&amp;E Notifications
setting for the calendar to Alert and also Status bar notification. Both
will play the calendar alert sound not the status bar sound. HTC EVO

<what>Having the same issue with the same phone, same OS release and same version of HTC Sync.  In my case EVERY event synced by HTC Sync has an alert go off at the exact start time of the event.  However, NO events have a reminder set, either in Outlook or on the phone.

My default reminder is set at 5 minutes before, so it is unlikely related.  I am pretty sure that the alert sound is different from my normal Gmail calendar alert sound.  Trying to research the symptoms by setting an Outlook event a few minutes after the sync time have not generated the sound.  Only those that occur some number of hours in the future make the sound.

Two emails and two phone calls to HTC support confirm this is a common issue.  Their solution was wait for HTC sync version 3.0, which is supposedly a complete rewrite by a new supplier to them.

While it MAY be caused by HTC Sync, Android OS is allowing it to occur.  My unwanted alerts will continue go off until all synced events pass, are deleted or until I disable the PC Sync calendar, even if I never sync again.  ItQ&apos;Es hard to blame the HTC Sync software thatQ&apos;Es no longer in use.

settings, or just not being in a 3G zone (EGDE in my case). 2. Start a
call. 3. Wait until a sync starts - the data transfer will drop the
call. This is LUDICROUS design, data transfers should NOT happen when a
call is going on and the phone is on 2G. Phone and network: Nexus One

Both times the Wi-Fi was enabled and while first time the signal bar was showing GPRS network second time today it was 3G network. I have never encountered this problem before and the only new application I have installed in last few days is WAZE and using that seems to overheat the phone. I wonder if any of this is useful or not but guess here are my two cents. Hope it gets resolved quickly.</what>

<description>Bizarre! The attached photo was taken with a Nexus S running the android
2.3.1 (build GRH78) stock camera app. It is a photo of a Dell Latitude
13 running Win 7 and Chrome (if any of that matters) showing the
gmail.com login page. The camera is able to take this picture with no
problem. But, move closer to the screen (so that the Gmail icon is at
the top of the frame and the Less Spam icon is at the bottom - both near
the left edge of the cameraQ&apos;Es view) and snap a picture and the camera
app will freeze and not save the picture. The Back, Menu, and Search
buttons will stop working; only the Home button will work (aborting the
camer app). I was able to duplicate the problem while submitting this
report (using a different monitor - an ACER 1920x1080 HDMI display). The
camera wonQ&apos;Et always freeze when up close - but it seems to happen more
frequently when there is a horizontal line near the top of the picture.
A possibly similar bug might be

<what>
IQ&apos;Em an app developer and making a camera app named FxCamera.
I have a similar problem on Nexus S(2.3.1) with both pre-installed camera app and my app.

the following is the case of my app
 - when app calls Camera#takePicture, sometimes Camera goes wrong
   without throwing any exception/error 
   (and PictureCallback never come)
 - it seems that SIGSEGV (Segmentation Fault) was occurred!
   (see the attached file which is an output of logcat)

frequency of this problem is highly dependent on picture(subject) what I take.
Q&quot;Ewhite noiseQ&quot;E image causes this problem frequently, almost 100% in my case.
  (e.g. shot this image. http://bootyourbroker.com/blog/analysis-paralysis/whitenoise/ )

I guess this is a bug of JPEG encoder or something
and I hope this is a Nexus S specific problem, not a gingerbread prob..

<what>Yes, this is harmless (though Fadden is correct - the message shouldnQ&apos;Et be delivered as a LOGE).  This situation should never occur on an actual device Q&gt;E armv5te, and in any event represents a missed performance opportunity rather than a correctness problem.  IQ&apos;Ell change the LOGEQ&apos;Es to LOGDQ&apos;Es.</what>

<what>Hi, IQ&apos;Eve got the same issue here:

my little casual game (*), involving a little homemade physics engine, and executed on an Alcatel One Touch 990 device (**) generates the same log output several times per second.

My main concern is not about the output itself, but about the consequence in the jitter in terms of framerate: the fps changes constantly and makes the animation jerky.

I would have preferred to be able to completely disable JIT to have (maybe lower but at least) constant fps, but I didnQ&apos;Et found any way to do the same. 

Regards,

Nouknouk.


(*) https://market.android.com/details?id=fr.bouncebox.beta.app

(**) donQ&apos;Et know if it helps, but:
- CPU Single core, 600 MHz, QUALCOMM MSM 7227-1
- version 2.2.2
- kernel 2.6.32.9-perf
- build FRG83G.v58L-0

<description>The notifications bar is buggy. if you leave your messaging program in a
conversation (for example, you pressed the home button instead of the
back button after replying) and another message comes, even if the phone
is locked, all notifications and alarms stop making sound or vibrating.
I used to rely on my phone for all alarms but I canQ&apos;Et now.</description>

<what>I just recreated it. Try this:

Send yourself a test email, pull down the notification bar and open the email, now
press home. Send yourself a second email, for me it vibrated and showed up for two
seconds then disappeared.

Maybe itQ&apos;Es only when you leave new emails open and press home. </what>

<what> It seems that android keeps the messaging programs running in the background as if 
they were in the foreground; when a new message comes in it assumes the messaging 
window is already displayed and you see it even though the messages program is 
running in the background.

As issue 1229 says, Android sould be able to know when a messaging/notification 
window is open in the forground vs. open in the background.  Notifications should 
not be removed until the notification window, whether it is gmail, messaging, or 
calllog, is set to visible and the user interacts with the screen in some way.  Say 
you get a new email when the phone is locked, even if the last window on the screen 
was gmail the notification should not be removed until the phone is unlocked and the 
user touches the email or scrolls or something similar.  This would ensure that not 
only does the window have to be active, but the user also has to be interacting with 
the screen so the phone knows it was seen.

It also appears that this same bug can mess up the alarm and needs to be debugged so 
an open gmail or messaging window doesnQ&apos;Et prevent your alarm clock from going off.</what>

<description>Sometimes when pressing buttons in the browser, it will register the
touch, but not actually _press_ the button. For example, on a log in
page, pressing a Q&quot;Elog inQ&quot;E button should log me in and proceed to load a
new page (as indicated in the progress bar). However, this bug makes it
so pressing a Q&quot;Elog inQ&quot;E button will highlight the button, yet will load
nothing and just stay on the log in page (no progress bar). The problem
seems erratic and differs by website and time. Model: Droid Firmware v.:
2.1-update1 Baseband v.: C_01.3E.03P Kernel v.: 2.6.29-omap1-g7fa8788

<what>Unfortunately, there is no particular website where this happens frequently. It seems to happen on different websites at random times. If I find any site where this happens with consistency, I will report it.

Yes, the button turns an orange-ish hue when being pressed. As stated above, the button is highlighted, but no action is taken.

I donQ&apos;Et know what an Q&apos;Eadb logcatQ&apos;E is. But if you can point me to some information, I will try to get it when the problem next occurs. Thanks.</what>

<description>Unable to retrieve portfolios created on the Google Finance web site to
be added to the Google Finance android app. Google Finance always gets
stuck in Q&quot;ELoading portfolios from Google FinanceQ&quot;E. The only way I was
able to get a portfolio partially loaded was by adding a ticker within
Android, and then separately on my PC/web interface adding more tickers
to that portfolio. This is makes Google Finance essentially useless for
checking portfolios that were created online. I think this might be due
to my large portfolios which have 20+ tickers.</description>

<description>I have ten folders on my home screens, which have been working fine. Now
I find that one has stopped working - I can move it, I can highlight it,
but it ignores clicks and will not open! All other folders open fine. A
reboot fixed it, but thereQ&apos;Es some vulnerability there.</description>

<description>we have a mobile app that we developed to run on the android platform,
that app has a feature to remember username during login which work as
follow: 1. user selects the save user name feature at the login screen
2. At every successful login mobile app send the request to server with
user selection. 3. Based on mobile request server generates the unique
ID and masked username mapped to that particular username ( note that
for security purposes we decided not to store the username on the
device) 4. mobile app receives the newly generated token and masked
username to set the http cookies on the client. 5. every subsequent
login, username field is prefilled with masked username from the stored
cookies and the saved token cookie is send back to server along with
password for authentication. 6. server find the username based on
recieved token and proceed with authentication.It also deletes the
existing token, and regenerates the new token and send back 7. mobile
web updates/sets the cookie with new token value. This whole flow works
flawlessly on desktop browsers including safari, chrome and firefox. but
on android browser cookie values are not getting persisted. If user
force stop the browser it looses the stored cookie information.and most
recent token value never get persisted on the browsers cookies, hance
login fails. we have also seen the andriod OS automatically
shutting/killing the running browser in case of high memory usage, hence
it looses all its cookie state. We would like to know how the memory
mangement is been done at the android OS, and at what point the cookies
value are getting sunc and persistent to the local storage. Is there any
possible way that we could use to force the android browser to
write/persist the cookies? Thank you for the help</description>

<description>I have a Nexus One. When I open the default sms application and tap Q&quot;Enew
messageQ&quot;E I get to the screen with the Q&quot;Esend toQ&quot;E and Q&quot;Etext bodyQ&quot;E fields.
If I type, for exhample Q&quot;EcarQ&quot;E in the Q&quot;Esend toQ&quot;E field, I expect a drop
down menu showing my contacts being filtered down to, say, Q&quot;ECarl, Carol
and CarsonQ&quot;E; instead nothing happens. If I enter the exact name of a
contact I receive an error message as well. The field seems to only
accept entries which are phone numbers already. I think this is not the
way it was designed to behave. Please forgive me if some Q&quot;ElabelQ&quot;E is
inaccurate, I donQ&apos;Et use the interface in english, I hope my description
is clear enough and I am at your dsposal for further clarifications.</description>

<what>Update, I was partially wrong, the name completion does work but only with the
contacts created by the phone itself (or merged from google as far as I could see).
Contacts imported from the SIM are not recognized. I was going to Q&quot;Etidy upQ&quot;E my
contact list anyway but still it is a bit uncomfortable.</what>

<description>In order to allow 3G USIM card based authentication, an API exposing
EAP-AKA is needed. Issue 9329 requests EAP-SIM. This is for 2G one way
SIM based authentication, 3G (AKA) authentication is mutual.
Additionally issue 9329 seems to imply EAP-SIM is only useful for WPA
authentication. While wifi is definitely an important use case for
EAP-SIM and EAP-AKA, however, it is not the only one. Therefore, a
standalone API for EAP-AKA and EAP-SIM is probably better, ideally as
part of a SIM access API.

<description>BACKGROUND: There are times in life when one wishes to stop using one
particular e-mail address and start using another instead. This is
without having to lose old e-mails and other kind of personal data that
in some way or another is connected with that said e-mail address. In
the case of Android, one has this primary Google Account that one links
up the whole system (the phone) with. To have to wipe the system just
because one wants to start using another Google Account instead of the
old one is not a very smart design. FEATURE REQUEST: Since one now can
add multiple Google Accounts in Android, I request a feature to choose
the primary among them. Alternatively, or in addition, that one can tick
a box while adding a new account to make it the new primary one.</description>
